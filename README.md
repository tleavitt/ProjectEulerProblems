# ProjectEulerProblems
Just me having fun. A collection of my solutions to some interesting problems on projecteuler.net.  

Project Euler is meant to be a fun problem solving exercise. While you’re welcome to use/borrow/draw inspiration 
from my code here, the goal and the fun should lie in solving the problem itself, not copying someone else’s solution!
